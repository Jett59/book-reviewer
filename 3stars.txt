Fairly basic language.
Probably suited for primary school students.
Made me think a bit.
Liked it.
One of those books which is nice the first time, but terrible the second time.
Bought it but stopped reading at the first page.
Nice book, very sad, but the ending was very predictable and at points the writing style was pretty annoying.
It was an ok read. Knew what was going to happen before the end.
Not very in depth study of characters. certainly did not live up to hype.
Libro muy bueno y f√°cil de leer. Le pongo 3 estrellas en vez de 5 por la baja calidad del papel, de las tapas y del encuadernado
