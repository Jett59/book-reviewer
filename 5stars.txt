Best book ever!
You haven't lived if you haven't read this!
Totally worth $10 at the corner book shop.
Very good book.
My new favorite!
WOW!
I just read it one riveting session and I think I am in shock.
Don't want to come back to the real world.
Never have i ever read a book that makes me crave the next book. This one does.
Looking forward to the rest of the series.
I LOVED this book!
From page one I was hooked and devoured it within days!
CANNOT WAIT for the next one!
One of the best books i have ever read.
The twists and storyline caused me to not even put it down!
Amazing!
Great book!
Couldn’t put it down and didn’t get much sleep!
Can’t wait for the next one.
