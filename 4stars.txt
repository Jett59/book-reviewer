Very good book.
Kept me reading right to the end.
Very entertaining.
Looking forward to the sequel.
Recommend this book.
Interesting plot.
Surprisingly easy to read for a 'classic'.
Very clever.
Not too long.
I didnâ€™t quite know what to expect as I started reading this, but the more I read, the more I enjoyed!
I like the metaphor and meaning to the book.
It is an easy read and keeps you interested throughout one more word.
