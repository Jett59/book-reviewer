Giving this a 1 because I can't give it a 0!
Terrible plot.
Complete waste of money.
Don't buy this book!
I expected more.
Sueing the shop for this!
The illustrations are terrible. They appear to be drawn by a Jr High school student. They are the type of pictures I would expect to illustrate a small childrenâ€™s book. Sent it back and got the one illustrated by Alan Lee and I am very happy now.
I was super excited to get this. The book itself is lovely. But the copy I received had a broken binding and the hardback was somehow very curved and ruined. The top pages also had large diagonal dent across the top. So disappointed.
I left the gift in the box and when the person opened the gift the binder of the book was broke.
