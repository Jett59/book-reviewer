Giving this a 1 because I can't give it a 0!
Terrible plot.
Complete waste of money.
Don't buy this book!
I expected more.
Sueing the shop for this!
The illustrations are terrible. They appear to be drawn by a Jr High school student for a small children's book.
The copy I received had a broken binding and the hardback was somehow very curved and ruined. The top pages also had large diagonal dent across the top. So disappointed.
I left the gift in the box and when the person opened the gift the binder of the book was broke.
