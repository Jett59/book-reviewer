Found it hard to keep interest after the first chapter.
A bit too basic for me.
Waste of money.
Don't recommend this book.
Plot jumped around a bit too much. Confuzing.
I took it back to the shop. They said that there was no refund.
I didn't enjoy this book as I found there was a lack of character development and a tedious plot.
After reading the reviews, I was super-disappointed by this book! DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.
Not at all well written and story is nowhere near as good as daughter hoped it would be.
Itâ€™s too slow for me.
Title kinda says it all.
